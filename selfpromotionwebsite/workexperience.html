		<h4>	RZ Group – Bolton<br>
				Job Title – IT Recruitment Consultant<br>
				Dates of Employment: January 2017 – July 2017
		</h4>
		<p>
			I was brought into RZ to head up their IT recruitment function. They had previously done some recruitment for their clients in the IT market and brought me on board in order to expand their presence in the national market. My role was to come up with and execute an effective business development strategy using contacts I already had in the industry as well as networking with potential new clients. I did this through various methods such as attending networking events, cold calling, and referrals from previous clients/candidates. Once I started the process of working with a client, I would liaise with them on any current open vacancies in order to understand their needs and then use my candidate attraction skills to fill those vacancies. This could be through using LinkedIn, job boards, networking events, referrals and advertising. During my time with RZ I built up a strong pipeline of clients and left them in a much stronger position than when I started.<br><br>

		<h4>	Hays Specialist Recruitment – Manchester<br>
				Job Title – IT Recruitment Consultant<br>
				Dates of Employment: October 2015 – December 2016
		</h4>

		<p>
			I joined Hays initially as a Resourcer before being promoted to Recruitment Consultant in February 2016. Having no prior recruitment experience, this role was a massive learning curve for me. I very quickly built up a knowledge and understanding of the IT recruitment industry. This is all down to having set up good candidate attraction plans to reach the mass market including organizing candidate events as well as connecting with relevant people on LinkedIn, sending batch emails, posting adverts and CV searching. Due to unfortunate changes in the market, in April 2016, the Manchester based healthcare team was disbanded. This gave me the opportunity to move internally to the IT recruitment team, specifically managing a contract infrastructure desk. In this role I have built the business up using my skills in business development to develop relationships with key clients. I currently have 7 contractors working for me at the moment but expect that to grow quickly. Candidate attraction and generation is something I feel I am very strong in and it’s also what I enjoy most about the role.<br><br>

		<h4>	Marks and Spencer – Bolton, Middlebrook<br>
				Job Title – Customer Assistant<br>
				Dates of Employment: Oct 2014 – Dec 2014 / Feb 2015 – Oct 2015
		</h4>
		<p>
			I began at Marks and Spencer on a temporary Christmas contract originally and was then re-employed 6 weeks after leaving. I worked in the foods department where I took pride in being responsible for my own section and the products within it. The section I was responsible for is an important part of the store layout with it being the first aisle most customers go through on their journey around the store. Therefore my managers trusted me to deliver a high standard of work on a daily basis. I regularly liaised with my commercial manager on any potential changes I could make to continuously improve my section whether it be the extension of well performing lines or purely cosmetic. Studying business at college has helped me to understand business strategies and how important they are in delivering excellent customer service.
