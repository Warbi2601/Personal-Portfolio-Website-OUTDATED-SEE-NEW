		<h4>Breakout Game</h4>
		<p>
			This was a project undertaken across 3 months as part of my Component Programming Module at University. It was developed in C# Windows Forms using Visual Studio 2017. The final version of the game includes numerous features including randomised colouring of each block which was done using an array of colours. There is also endless generating levels that shows a running points tally as you progress through using both a tally in game as well as on each "Next Level" and "End Game" Screen. This project was a massive learning curve considering I had no prior coding experience but it is something I plan to build on in the future.

		<h4>Christmas Tree Creator</h4>
		
		<p>
			This was a Christmas project that was part of my Fundamentals of Programming Module at University. It took around 6 hours to fully complete. The programs key function is to take a number and print a Christmas Tree of that size. The hardest part about this project was understanding the boolean expressions required in order to generate the spaces from the beginning to the "#'s", the spaces after in order to keep the border in line and of course the "#'s" themselves. The program includes a few extra features including relevant colours for the tree, trunk and decoration as well as a random decoration atop the tree each time, this was done using a switch statement.
